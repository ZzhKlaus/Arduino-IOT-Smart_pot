# Arduino-IOT-Smart_pot
A simple IOT smart pot system using Arduino UNO using thingsSpeak as the platform.

Components: Arduino UNO, ESP8266, lm35 temperature sensor, speaker, water level sensor, soil moisture sensor, LCD, water pump,Â potted plant...

Function: Detect the temperature, soil moisture, water level and automatically pumping water into the pot if water is needed or temperature goes high; broadcasting if the stored water is not enough; transmitting the detected data to ThingSpeak through ESP8266 and draw the graph, as listed below.
